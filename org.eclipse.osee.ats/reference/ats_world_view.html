		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Shows ATS workflow objects including Actions, Team Workflows, Tasks and Reviews that were
		returned from a search normally performed by the ATS Navigator.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		Double-click search item from ATS Navigator.  ATS World will show that it is loading.  Upon
		return, ATS World will contain all ATS objects from the search.  In addition, a plus is shown
		next to any object.  Upon selection, viewer will expand to show all children of the selected
		object.
		<h2>Open ATS Action, Team Workflow, Task or Review</h2>
		Double-click to open any item open in ATS Workflow Editor.
		<h2>Sorting</h2>
		Selecting column headers will sort that column.  Holding down Ctrl and selecting successive
		columns will enable multi sort.  Re-selecting a column will reverse sort that column.  
		The status label at the bottom will show the columns being sorted and which direction the
		sort is being performed.  To remove all sorting, right-click and select "Remove All Sorting".
		<h2>Bottom Status Line</h2>
		The bottom status line will show the total number of objects loaded into the table, the total
		shown and the total selected.  It will also show all the sorts and filters that are enabled.
		<h2>Top Status Line</h2>
		The top status line will show the name of the search that populated the ATS World View.  A 
		warning icon (<img src="../images/warn.gif"/>) will show if the search returned no objects to show.
		<h2>Filtering</h2>
		Bottom right of the ATS World shows a filter box that is a quick way to filter by one or two words.
		Simply type in a string, press enter and ATS World will only show those loaded objects that where one of the 
		visible cells contains the typed text.  This is a case in-sensitive search.  Select the clear 
		action (<img src="../images/clear.gif"/>) to clear out the text and restore all loaded actions.
