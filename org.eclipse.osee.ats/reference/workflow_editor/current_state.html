		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Shows current state information and allows edit to those users that are authorized for edit.
		<h2>Assignees</h2>
		Selecting Assignees at the top of the current state allows the current assignee to add/remove
		the assignees that are allowed to make changes to the current state.  Any number of users can
		be selected.
		<h2>Data Entry</h2>
		The state has certain fields that are requested/need to be entered.  Red labels denotes a field
		that is requried for transition for to the next state.  A black label denotes a field that is
		optional for transition to the next state.
		<h2>Services</h2>
		On the left resides a list of services that either provide information and/or allow for the entry
		of information for the givent ATS objects.  If the service is black text, there is no ability
		to edit the information.  If the service is blue with underlined (hyperlinked), then the data
		can be edited through seleciton of the service.
		<h2>Transition</h2>
		Select the state to transition to (default is already selected), and choose the assingees
		that should perform the next state (default is already selected).  No data is lost when
		transitioning to a previous state.
		<h2>Assignees</h2>
		If assigned to a state, the Assignees label is hyperlinked in the current state and allows
		for adding/removing assignees.  Any number of users can be assigned to any in-work state.
		Removing the current user and adding a different user re-assigns the object to that user.
