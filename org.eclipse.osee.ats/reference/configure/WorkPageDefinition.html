   <h1>Work Page Definition Artifact</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Work Page Definition artifact configures a single state of the <a href="WorkFlowDefinition.html>
		Workflow Definition</a> for a <a href="WorkflowConfiguration.html">Workflow Configuration</a>. 
		
		<h2>How to do it - <a href="WorkflowConfigurationEditor.html">ATS Workflow Configuration Editor</a></h2>
		The ATS Workflow Configuration Editor will allow the editing of the three main fields of a
		Work Page Definition Artifact.  The remaining fields, and the relations to <a href="WorkRuleDefinition.html">
		Work Rules</a> and <a href="WorkWidgetDefinition.html">Work Widgets</a> must be done through the
		Artifact Editor.
      
		<h2>How to do it - Artifact Editor</h2>
		Work Page Definitions are either stored as children of their Work Flow Definition artifact or 
		under the "Work Pages" folder.
		<br>
		On the Common branch in the Artifact Editor, Expand "Action Tracking System" and right-click
		on "Work Page", select New Child -> Work Page Definition, or double-click an existing Work Page
		Definition artifact.  Edit the following attributes and relations accordingly.
		<br><br>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Name:[unique name matching Work Id below]</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Id:[unique workflow namespace].[Work Page Name] as below.</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Parent Work Id:[Work Id of Parent Work Page Definition] - this will allow
         this workflow to inherit it's widgets and rules from another workflow.  This
         can not be used with other attributes below</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Page Name:State Name that the user will see.  This can not have any 
         special characters including . in the name.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Relations</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Work Item.Child: Relate to any Rules or Widgets that this state is made of.</li>
      </ul>
</body>
