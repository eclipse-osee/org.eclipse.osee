		<h1>ATS Workflow Configuration Editor</h1>
		<br/>
		<img border="1" src="configEditor.jpg"/>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Give a graphical method to creating / updating ATS Workflow Configurations.  This editor
		also gives easy access, through double-click" to edit the "Work Page Definition" artifact
		that represent the selected state.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		<ul>
		   <li>Open editor for a specific workflow:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Existing Work Flow Definition Artifact: From Common branch in Artifact Explorer, expand Action Tracking System -> Work Flows
            and double-click the workflow you wish to edit.</li>
            <li>From ATS Workflow Editor: Select workflow icon at top right and associated workflow
            will be opened.</li>
            <li>New Workflow Configuration: File -> New -> Other -> OSEE ATS -> Workflow Configuration;
             Enter unique namespace for this workflow configuration. (eg: org.<company>.code).  This 
             creates a simple workflow to use as a starting place.</li>
         </ul>
         
		   <li>Create states:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Add necessary states to diagram to represent workflow.  Note: Only one state
            is the entry point and the workflow must end at the "Completed" state.  The "Cancelled"
            state is optional, but should be used in most cases.</li>
         </ul>
         
		   <li>Editing Rules, Widgets and other State attributes:  Double-click on any state to open
		   the Artifact in the Artifact Editor.</li>

 		   <li>Create transitions:</li>
         <ul>
	         <li>For each state, a single "Default Transition" must be specified.  This will
	         be the default state specified as the "next" state in the workflow.  Optional transitions
	         to other states can be specified by the "Transition" arrow.  The user will have the 
	         option of selecting one of these states instead.</li>
	         <li>The "Return Transition" can be specified for valid jumps "back" to previous states.
	         (eg: The user may need to transition back to the "Analyze" state from the "Authorize"
	         state if authorization failed and more analysis is needed.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Select a single state and set it's "Start Page" property to "Yes" for the state
         specified to start the workflow.  Only one state can be the start state.</li>
 		   <li>Save and test the new workflow configuration:</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Select Save to persist the changes.  Validation will be automatically run (see below)</li>
               <li><a href="TeamDefinition.html">Configure the Team Definition</a> to use the new workflow</li>
               <li>Create a new Action and test the created workflow</li>
            </ul>
         <li>   
      </ul>
      <h2>Workflow Configuration - Validation</h2>
		Validation of a workflow is provided by selecting the check icon and selecting a state,
		transition or the entire workflow (selecting the white background).  This will popup
		whatever error occurs or a "Validation Success" if all is ok.<br><br>
		Note: This same validation will occur during save and will fail if all problems are not resolved.
