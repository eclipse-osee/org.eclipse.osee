<h1>Configure ATS for Change Tracking</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
ATS is used to track any type of change throughout the lifecycle of a
project. Below are the steps to configure ATS for tracking something
new.
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Review <a href="../overview/ats_overview.html">ATS
	Overview</a> to understand ATS Concepts, Terms and Architecture. Pay
	special attention to ATS Terms</li>
	<li>Determine what Actionable Items (AIs) need to be available to
	the user to select from. This can be anything from a single AI for
	tracking something like a tool or even an activity that needs to be
	done to a hierarchical decomposition of an entire software product or
	engineering program.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Considerations:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Item should be in the context of what the user would
			recognize. eg: OSEE ATS World View versus something unknown to the
			user such as AtsWorldView.java.</li>
			<li>Decompose AI into children AI when it is desired to
			sort/filter/report by that decomposition.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Actionable Item attributes to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Name: Unique name that the user would identify with.</li>
			<li>Active: yes (converted to "no" when AI is no longer
			actionable)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Actionable Item relations to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>TeamActionableItem: relate to Team Definition that is
			responsible for performing the tasks associated with this AI. NOTE:
			If this relation is not set, ATS will walk up the Default Hierarchy
			to find the first AI with this relation.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Determine the teams that are going to perform the tasks that
	are associated with the AIs selected by the user.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Considerations:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Use separate teams if certain changes are to be managed by
			different leads.</li>
			<li>Use separate teams if one team's completion and releasing is
			independent of another's.</li>
			<li>Use separate teams if team members are separate.</li>
			<li>Use separate teams if different workflows are required for
			one set of AIs than another.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Team attributes to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Name: Unique team name that is distinguishable from other
			teams in a list.</li>
			<li>Description: Full description of the team and it's scope.</li>
			<li>Active: yes (converted to "no" when AI is no longer
			actionable)</li>
			<li>Team Uses Versions: yes if team workflows are going to use
			the build management and release capabilities of ATS.</li>
			<li>Full Nam: Extended name for the team. Expansion of acronym
			if applicable</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Team relations to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>TeamActionableItem: relation to all AIs that this team is
			responsible for.</li>
			<li>Work Item.Child: WorkFlowDefinition artifact
			configures the state machine that
			this team works under. NOTE: If this relation is not set, ATS will
			walk up the Default Hierarchy to find the first AI with this
			relation.</li>
			<li>TeamLead: User(s) that are leading this team. These users
			will be assigned to the Endorse state of the Team Workflow upon
			creation of an Action by a user. Providing multiple leads reduces
			bottlenecks. First lead to handle the Team Workflow wins.</li>
			<li>TeamMember: User(s) that are members of the team. These
			users will be shown first as preferred assignees and have the ability
			to privileged edit a Team Workflow for the team they belong to.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Choose existing WorkFlowDefinition or create new WorkFlowDefinition
	 to be used by the team and relate it to Team Definition (as
	above).  This can be done through File->New->Workflow Configuration.  Enter a namespace
	and a default workflow will be created and can be edited.</li>
	<li>Create version artifacts necessary (if using versions) and
	relate them to Team Definition (as above)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If branching of artifacts is going to be used (see below), configure versions
		with their appropriate parent branch id.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Determine if Branching within one of the states in the workflow is desired/required
	and configure as appropriate.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Considerations:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Branching is necessary if objects to change are stored in OSEE as artifacts.
			If so, OSEE ATS can create a working branch off the parent branch, allow user
			to modify artifacts and then commit these changes when complete, reviewed and
			authorized (as necessary).  If objects are stored outside OSEE (eg. code files
			checked into SVN), this option is not necessary.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Configure ATS workflow for branching:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Create AtsStateItem extension specifying which state the branching will occur.
			This is normally in the Implement state of a workflow.</li>
			<li>Create root branch and import documents that will be managed through define
			and tracked through ATS.</li>
			<li>Set all Version artifacts "Parent Branch Id" attribute to the branch id
			of the root branch (or child branches, if using multi-branching)</li>
			<li>If only a single branch is to be used OR versioning is NOT configured to be
			used, the "Parent Branch Id" should be s</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

</ul>
