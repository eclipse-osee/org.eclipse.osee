		<h1>Peer To Peer Review Workflow</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Peer To Peer Review is a lightweight review type that enables interactive one-on-one reviews where two people sit
		at a single computer and review, disposition and resolve the issues as they are found.  This review type does not 
		require (but does allow) defects to be logged.  This review type can be created as a stand-alone review or attached to
		any workflow.  When attached to a workflow, it is related to a state and can be set as a "blocking" review that will
		keep the workflow from continuing until the review is completed.
