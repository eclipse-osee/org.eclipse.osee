# Commit Design Decisions

1.  Identify use cases
2.  Idenify all logic that could be implemented as a commit hook
3.  Idenitfy all possible conflicts (its.e. relation conflicts)
4.  All events must be propogated (i.e. merge)
5.  Branching logic on the server side
6.  Impacts of removing revert
7.  Look into simpler sql where we do processing in the code
8.  Regression tests (add, fix, replace)
