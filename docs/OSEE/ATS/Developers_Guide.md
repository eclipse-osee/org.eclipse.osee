## Goal Artifact to ATS - Design

Create a new grouping/planning object in ATS. This would allow
workflows, tasks, reviews to be grouped under a common

This goal object should be able to have attributes such as priority,
funding/ccn, user community, complexity, authorization, and etc that can
be set independently of workflows that are part of the goal. In
addition, it should have all the normal, est completion date, targeted
for version and etc. All other data should be rolled up from workflows
(like Actions).
