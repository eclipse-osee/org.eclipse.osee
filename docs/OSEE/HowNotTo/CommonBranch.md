It may seem to add to security to deny normal users access to the
‘Common’ branch.

However, doing so prevents the system writing back information for users
such as which branch they had selected.
The ‘Common’ branch must therefore be left with full access for all
users.
To control access to elements on the branch, use the access rights on
the Artifacts instead.
