The **ATS Navigator** is the central location for locating ATS objects.
Double clicking a navigation item will open it in the appropriate viewer
or editor. The **Filter** can be used to quickly locate ATS Navigator
objects containing the entered text. The **Search** box can be used to
search all ATS objects in the system. Checking the **IC** checkbox will
include completed and cancelled items in the search.
