# What is OSEE?
![osee.jpg](/docs/images/osee.jpg "osee.jpg")

The [Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE)](https://eclipse.dev/osee/) project provides a tightly
integrated environment supporting lean principles across a product's
full life-cycle in the context of an overall systems engineering
approach. The system captures project data into a common user-defined
data model providing bidirectional traceability, project health
reporting, status, and metrics which seamlessly combine to form a
coherent, accurate view of a project in real-time. By building on top of
this data model, OSEE has been architected to provide an all-in-one
solution to configuration management, requirements management, testing,
validation, and project management. All of these work together to help
an organization achieve lean objectives by reducing management
activities, eliminating data duplication, reducing cycle-time through
streamlined processes, and improving overall product quality through
work flow standardization and early defect detection.
