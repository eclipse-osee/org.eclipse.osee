title: Message Interface Modeler (MIM)
description: An overview of MIM
---

The purpose of the tool is to manage the software interfaces between
subsystems for a Product Line. MIM models the messages moving across the
network in detail, including their source, destination and composition. MIM
allows users to mark data artifacts with an applicability which is the
vessel by which Product Line is implemented.

The MIM tool can be used to export data in various formats. For example, an
ICD can be exported in an Excel Workbook format, or the data can be exported
into a zip of text files to be used in downstream tools. The
Reports page will list available reports for
your installation.

## Where to Start?

1. If you have never seen or used MIM before, check out this [Example ICD](/org.eclipse.osee/mim/example-icd) for a look at how ICDs are displayed in MIM
2. If you want to dive deeper into how the data is structured, take a look at the [MIM Data Model](/org.eclipse.osee/mim/datamodel)
3. When you're ready to create an ICD, follow [this guide](/org.eclipse.osee/mim/guides/create-icd) that walks through the whole process
4. For help with specific pages, take a look at our individual page documentation
