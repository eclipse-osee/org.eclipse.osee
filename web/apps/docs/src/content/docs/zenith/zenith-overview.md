description: An overview of Zenith
---

Zenith is a dashboard that displays detailed and historical test results from [OTE](https://github.com/eclipse-osee/org.eclipse.ote) test outputs. It provides the ability to categorize test results using CI Sets, and assign teams and subsystems to test scripts for accountability and team visibility. All of the benefits of OSEE apply to Zenith as well, including branching, change history, and traceability of test scripts to their corresponding requirements and code.

### Historical Results

One of the key features of Zenith is the ability to look back at previous runs of test scripts to determine when regressions happened, and see the overall health of the tested system over time. Timelines are available to get a both a high level view of all test results over time, as well as individual test scripts.

### CI Sets

CI Sets represent specific software versions or configurations, and allow users to view test results for just that specific set. When importing test results, a CI Set must be specified.
