description: An overview of OSEE
---

The Open System Engineering Environment is a tightly integrated,
extensible environment supporting Product Line Engineering in the
context of an overall systems engineering approach. It is
integrated around a simple data model providing
full life cycle traceability. OSEE's feature set includes Product
Line Engineering, configuration management, requirements
management, message modeling, testing, validation, and project management.

## Extensible Data Model

All project data is stored in OSEE's user-definable data model
which offers revision control, bidirectional traceability across
the full product life cycle, project status reporting, and
metrics.

## Full Lifecycle Support

The data integration and traceability features OSEE offers enable
a coherent view of a project across its full life-cycle.

## A Potent Framework

OSEE offers a full-featured Java API and REST web services for
seamless integration of COTS and open-source software enabling
developers to harness OSEE's powerful data management capabilities
for their own project.

## Product Line Engineering

OSEE's Product Line Engineering provides systematic, strategic
reuse of engineering artifacts across the full product life cycle.
OSEE's advanced branch management capabilities, including
automated change reporting and conflict detection, make it
possible to control many variants of a project with ease. Since
OSEE retains a full revision history of every artifacts in the
system, engineers can make and review changes with greater
confidence.
