        <div>
        Priority defaults to 0 when an Issue is initiated.
        The Cognizant engineer(s) assess the priority and assign a value ranging from 1-5, according to the table below, 
        when the Issue is in Open or Investigation State. 
        During HIT review of the Issue the priority may be changed.  
        Assessment of priority is from the perspective of the end user of a fielded product 
        (i.e. if the issue is not resolved prior to Software Baseline Verification Testing (SBVT)).
