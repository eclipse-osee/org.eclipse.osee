<h2>Welcome to the Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE)</h2>
<blockquote>OSEE provides a tightly integrated environment
that supports lean engineering across the full product life-cycle. Since
OSEE integrates all engineering areas, the full lifecycle data for a
product is managed by a common platform allowing this data to be
seamlessly combined to form a coherent, accurate view of a project in
real-time. At the heart of the OSEE architecture are the OSEE core
services and application framework which are available to all the OSEE
applications and enable their tight integration. <br>
<br>
The vision for OSEE finds concrete grounding in daily use by Subject
Matter Experts developing next generation mission software for an
existing Boeing aircraft. This direct involvement with a full-scale
deployment of OSEE allows important user feedback to be rapidly
incorporated back into both OSEE itself and as lessons learned for the
development team. <br>
<br>
Since OSEE has been developed for use by separate groups of end users,
careful attention has been given to providing a proper separation of
core OSEE capabilities and specific extensions made for various groups.
The requirement to support separate groups has helped ensure that OSEE
is extensible through standard Eclipse mechanisms. The OSEE architecture
is designed to provide an integrated, extensible engineering environment
that can be adopted by any group engaged in engineering.</blockquote>

</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>If this is your first time using OSEE, it is recommended that
	you begin by learning the Workbench and how to navigate around.&nbsp;
	The few minutes you spend here will enable quick and efficient use of
	the basic framework.&nbsp; Start by Selecting Help -&gt; Help Content
	-&gt; Workbench Users Guide.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>From there, it is recommended that you look through any of the
	items in the Help Contents that correlate to your specific tasks.  You can
	also press F1 at any time for context-sensitive help.</p>
