== Computed Characteristic Purpose and Use

Computed Characteristics are similar to attribute types, except the value is derived from a calculation rather than a user set value.

For example, given the two attribute types "Start Index" and "End Index", then "Length" might be a computed characteristic that is calculated from the difference of the two plus one.

Can support arbitrarily complex (i.e. custom) calculations as well and predefined ones such as:

	Rate		Numerator is delta of <type parameter>	Denominator is a duration
		duration is the time delta
	Ratio		Ratio of <type parameter>
		A ratio is a quotient where the numerator and denominator have the same units.
	Delta		Delta of <type parameter>
	Quotient	numerator is a <type parameter>	denominator is a <type parameter> (not Duration)
	Product		multiplicand is a <type parameter> and multiplier is a <type parameter>
	sum
	average

== Computed Characteristic Requirements

Must support arbitrarily complex calculations.

The computed characteristic value shall not be directly modifiable (cannot be set through functionality like setSoleAttribute()). The only method to setting this value will be through calculations done using the relevant attribute types. The computed Characteristic will be recalculated every time it is obtained via the API.

Compile time checking will be used to ensure the compatibility of the attribute type's parameterized type (e.g. Integer, String).

At runtime, during token definition, the multiplicity of the supplied attribute type(s) will be checked for compatibility with the predefined calculation. Examples for the predefined calculations as follows:
	Rate, Ratio, Delta, Quotient - Provided attribute types must have max 1 multiplicity
	Product, Sum, Average - Provided attributes types can have any multiplicity

When the computed characteristic value is accessed via the API, an exception will be thrown if referenced attribute instances are not valid for the relevant artifact.

An invalid value shall not be displayed to the user to avoid returning false/misleading information.

== Computed Characteristic Details/Design

Computed Characteristic is a interface that extends NamedId. Contains a calculate function for doing arbitrarily complex calculations. Results can be obtained through a getComputedCharacteristic(ComputedCharacteristicToken<T>) method in ArtifactReadable. Generics will be used in order to ensure supplied attribute types have compatible parameterized types. (Generic <T> represents the specific calculation object being utilized (e.g. LengthCharacteristic)). This will be done by utilizing a validity check method .isComputedCharacteristicValid() in ArtifaceReadable.

== Declaring a Computed Characteristic

Given attribute types such as

	AttributeTypeInteger start = osee.createInteger(...L, "start", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN, "Starting Point");
	AttributeTypeInteger end = osee.createInteger(...L, "end", MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN, "Ending Point");
  LengthCharacteristic length = new LengthCharacteristic(start, end);
  
You declare a computed characteristic on an artifact just as you would an artifact type. A runtime check will exception out if referenced attribute types are not valid for the relevant artifact type.

	 ArtifactTypeToken Measurements = osee.add(osee.artifactType(...L, "Measurements", false, Artifact)
      .zeroOrOne(start)
      .zeroOrOne(end)
      .computed(length);


== Additional Tasks

	Update new search mechanism for computed characteristics
	Adding engineering units to attribute types
	CompoundComputedCharacteristic

== Considerations for the future

Consider storing expensive values in the future (toggle case)
