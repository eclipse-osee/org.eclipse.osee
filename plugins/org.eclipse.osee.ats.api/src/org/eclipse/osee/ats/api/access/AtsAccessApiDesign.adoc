Provides the classes necessary to answer Framwork calls to compute access for branch objects like artifacts, attributes and relations

See FrameworkAccessDesign.adoc for explanation of Framework Access Control, which ATS contributes to.  This design builds on top of that.

== Classes: 

=== AtsAccessContextTokens
Tokens to specify certain ATS Access conditions.

=== IAtsAccessContextProvider
Interface/server to contribute Access Control from other bundles/layers.  These will be looped through to determine which provider is applicable and then computeAccess will be called to calculate access.
