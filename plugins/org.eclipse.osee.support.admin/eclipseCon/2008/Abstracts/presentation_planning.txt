competitors, as Mike noted:

    You need to step out of your comfort zone as to what Eclipse is. It's no longer just about development tools. Eclipse now houses a wide range of "runtime" projects like application frameworks (service-oriented architecture (SOA) frameworks, etc.) or things one would expect to find in a Java application server.

    We've come up with a way to help multiple companies - including direct competitors - to work together on a level playing field to build next-generation platforms and then compete with the applications they build on top of this platform. In other words, they use Eclipse to collaborate on a platform and then compete on the products that run on the platform.

    Importantly, we're not just talking about enterprise software. In fact, Eclipse is now the standard for C/C++ development in the embedded/mobile market (the only real-time operating system company that hasn't standardized on Eclipse is Green Hills). So, in the mobile/embedded space we have Symbian, QNX, Wind River, Nokia, and others working together on common platforms, then aggressively competing on the products they build on top of these platforms.
