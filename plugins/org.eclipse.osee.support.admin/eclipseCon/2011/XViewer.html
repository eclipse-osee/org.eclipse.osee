<h1>Pimp your JFace TreeViewer with the Nebula XViewer</h1>

<p>The JFace TreeViewer is a great Viewer, but is lacking advanced features like filtering, sorting and searching.  In addition, there is no way for the end user to customize how they want to view the data.  The solution is the XViewer.  Converting a TreeViewer into an XViewer enhances the user experience by allowing them to dynamically interact with the data.</p>

<h3>An XViewer provides:</h3>

<b>To the User:</b>
<ul>
<li>Simple text filtering of loaded items using either string or regular expression</li>
<li>Searching of table contents that highlights results in the table</li>
<li>Customization of the table columns in real-time provides</li>
   <ul>
   <li>Ability to show or hide available columns</li>
   <li>Ability to sort individual columns both forward and reverse</li>
   <li>Ability to sort multiple columns in order</li>
   <li>Ability to provide individual filters for each column</li>
   <li>Ability to apply "computed columns" which provide calculations against an existing column</li>
   </ul>
<li>Save the above customizations for later use by any user</li>
<li>Toggle between saved customizations and set customizations as the default</li>
<li>Exporting visible data to HTML, CSV and PDF</li>
</ul>

<b>To the Developer:</b>
<ul>
<li>Easy Integration - XViewer extends JFace TreeViewer and default content and label providers</li>
<li>User Customization - Provide default table customization while allowing flexibility for users to tailor</li>
<li>Integrated Menus - Integrate XViewer menu items with your existing table context menus</li>
<li>Pre-defined column types (eg: String, Integer, Percents) with ability to application specific types</li>
</ul>

<b>This tutorial will show:</b>
<ul>
<li>How to take an existing TreeViewer and covert it over to an XViewer</li>
<li>How to implement the local and global storage of customizations</li>
<li>How to provide text, color, images and fonts to your table cells independent of each other </li>
<li>How to provide customized menus to integrate XViewer capabilities with your own context menus</li>
<li>How to create your own computed columns </li>
<li>How to use the bar-graph feature in a column to provide graphical bars for column data</li>
</ul>
