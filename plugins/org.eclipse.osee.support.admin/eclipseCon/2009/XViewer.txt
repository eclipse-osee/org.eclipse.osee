Short Talk - XViewer

XViewer - An SWT Widget with the power of the spreadsheet.

Abstract:
	
SWT widgets such as the table and tree viewer allow the Eclipse application developer to represent large amounts of data in a clear and concise format.  Advancements in these widgets allow for more flexibility in how the user wishes to view the data.  An example is the drag/drop of columns to change their order.  These are a great step forward, but do we really have to give up the power of the spreadsheet?

The XViewer has been created as an extension to the TreeViewer to allow the ability to

1) perform simple filter of all visible data using a keyword
2) filter on any column by string or regular expression
3) allow columns to be hidden or re-ordered
4) provide for customized sorting of column data
5) perform a multi-column sorting in the order of the selected columns
6) have simple table reports including exporting to comma separated value files

This talk will introduce the application developer to this widget and display not only the current capabilities, but those planned for the future.
