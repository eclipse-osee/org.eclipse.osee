Title:  OSEE, from www.eclipse.org/osee to deployment...

Abstract:  The Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE) eclipse project supports lean engineering across the full product life-cycle by providing an integrated and data-centric application framework. At its core is a persistence layer that provides a dynamic data model, advanced version control capabilities, and powerful search capabilities.  OSEE Define provides a full requirements management solution while OSEE ATS provides for configuration management through configured teams and workflows.  See http://www.eclipse.org/osee/ for more details.  Whether you're interested in taking advantage of the open source requirements managagement solution that provides full requirements authoring with branching, variants and full versioning, the high powered change/workflow management that is provided by the Action Tracking System (ATS), or building a stand-alone application on the OSEE Application Framework, this tutorial will help you go from www.eclipse.org/osee to something that you can deploy for your purposes.

	so the entry in the whole word array list did the opposite of what we wanted.  It turns out that the TIS is failing the instanceOf check.  It is using the defaultFactory.


define own data model starting from a 
initialize a local database using this data model
create a baseline branch for your engineering project.
After importing some existing requirements,
we will explore some of the essential requirements management capabilities.
configure the Action Tracking System by
 defining teams actionable items, and versions and connecting them to a workflow
	work through an instance of this newly created workflow including creating a working branch
	making and reviewing changes
	and committing back into the baseline branch.

A brief overview of the key OSEE extension points will be provided and then we will jump right in and extend one of them. 


You will have the opportunity to implement your own BLAM operation as a light-weight way to automate repetitive tasks that require user input.
