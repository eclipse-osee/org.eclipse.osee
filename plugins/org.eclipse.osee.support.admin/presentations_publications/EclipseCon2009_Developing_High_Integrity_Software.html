 <title>Developing High Integrity Software</title>
 </head>
 <body>
Difficulty:  Intermediate
Category:  Eclipse Ecosystem - Business and Industry

<p>Whether you develop mission/safety-critical systems or simply want the benefits of high quality engineering processes, this talk is for you.</p>

<p>The development of high-integrity systems is governed by stringent standards which require engineers to provide sufficient evidence of the quality of the developed artifacts. For instance, DO-178B "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification" provides guidelines for the production of avionics software: any software flying on civil aircraft must follow DO-178. Similar standards exist for other domains, such as automotive and industrial automation.</p>

<p>One of the most costly processes to put in place when developing high-quality software is providing end-to-end traceability between requirements, design elements, source code, test cases, and documentation.  This evidence is needed to increase the confidence that the software satisfies stakeholders&#39; expectations.  Since this evidence involves artifacts across the full development life-cycle, an integrated solution is needed in order to provide the required evidence in a cost effective manner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/osee">Open System Engineering Environment</a> (OSEE) is an integrated environment that enables developers to apply software engineering principles needed to build high integrity software. Using a user definable process and workflow and bidirectional traceability across the full development life-cycle, OSEE facilities the creation and management of the engineering artifacts that can be used as evidence when certifying the product&#39;s integrity.</p>

<p>In this presentation and live demonstration, we show how OSEE facilitates the qualification of a verification tool in the context of DO-178 level A (the highest criticality level). We use OSEE to design a traceability model across all development artifacts, and to put them in relation with our specific workflow, so as to assure that each development step is allocated, tracked and produces the expected output. In addition, we exploit OSEE&#39;s reporting capabilities to generate documented evidence of end-to-end traceability.</p>

<p>This presentation is prepared by Boeing and AdaCore. The OSEE team at Boeing provided support in the use of OSEE for the qualification of AdaCore tools in the context of DO-178. The lessons learned from this collaboration are expected to be applicable to anyone involved with DO-178B and more generally to those who are developing high integrity software.</p>

<h4>Original Version</h4>

<p>Whether you develop mission/safety-critical systems or simply value high quality code, this talk is for you. Developing high integrity software in a cost effective manner, especially for complex systems, requires an integrated engineering environment to guide developers through the development process and facilitate and automate as many engineering steps as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/osee">Open System Engineering Environment</a> (OSEE) enables developers to apply software engineering principles needed to build high integrity software.  Using an integrated, user definable process and workflow and bidirectional traceability across the full development life-cycle, OSEE facilities the creation and management of the engineering artifacts that can be used as evidence when certifying the product&#39;s integrity.</p>

<p>AdaCore is the leading provider of commercial, open software solutions for long-lived applications where reliability, efficiency and safety are absolutely critical.  AdaCore is working with the OSEE project to use OSEE for tool qualification for DO-178B of some of AdaCore&#39;s tools such as GNATcheck and its open source code coverage tool.  The lessons learned from this collaboration are expected to be useful to anyone involved with DO-178B and more generally those developing high integrity software.</p>

<p>DO-178B "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification" provides guidelines for the production of avionics software and its use it accepted by certification authorities such as the FAA and EASA.</p>
