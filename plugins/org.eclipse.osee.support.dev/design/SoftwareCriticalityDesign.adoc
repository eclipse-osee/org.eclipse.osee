== Software Safety Criticality Matrix:



|===
| |Severity Category (I-IV) | | |
|Software Control Category |Catastrophic (I) |Critical (II) |Marginal (III) |Negligible(IV)
|1	|SwCI 1 |SwCI 1 |SwCI 3 |SwCI 4
|2	|SwCI 1 |SwCI 2 |SwCI 3 |SwCI 4
|3	|SwCI 2 |SwCI 3 |SwCI 4 |SwCI 4
|4	|SwCI 3 |SwCI 4 |SwCI 4 |SwCI 4
|5(NSI) |SwCI 5 |SwCI 5 |SwCI 5 |SwCI 5
|===

== Table for unhandled inputs:

If one opens a requirement artifact with the artifact explorer, and it has 0 Software Control Category attributes and 1 Software Severity attribute, I assume it has no SwCI computed attribute.

To cover cases like above, here is a table:

|===
|Software Control Category |Safety Severity |Calculated SwCI
|Does not exist |	Does not exist |Does not exist
|Exists |Doesn’t |Doesn’t
|Doesn’t |Exists |Doesn’t
|Exists |Exists |Exists (as calculated)
|Unspecified |Has value |Unspecified
|Has Value |Unspecified |Unspecified
|Unspecified |Unspecified |Unspecified
