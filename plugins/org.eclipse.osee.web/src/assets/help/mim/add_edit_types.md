2. The User can either query an existing type to use as the base of their new type or start from scratch by clicking on the "+" sign on the lower left hand side of the screen.
3. If you choose to start from an existing Type, simply filter for the existing Type.
4. When you see the type you wish to use, Click on "Create New Type From Base"
5. Give your type a new name. You must change some of the attributes to make your new type distinct from others already defined.
6. If the "OK" or "Next" button is disabled that means you have not yet updated the fields to yield a distinct type. In other words, there is another type already defined with the exact same attributes defined. This is in place to prevent users from defining the same type repeatedly.
7. Once the "OK"/"Next" button is enabled, click on it
8. If creating a non-enumeration type, you are done and have the new type created which can now be used on an element.
9. If the type being created is an enumeration, you will now see the option to update the enumeration set associated with the new platform type. Add/Edit this set as needed using the "+" sign and/or delete icons to the right of the states.
10. When done editing the set, simply click on "OK" and you will have completed creating the platform type.
11. This type should now be available to choose in the platform type field of the structure page.

Creating Type from Scratch
