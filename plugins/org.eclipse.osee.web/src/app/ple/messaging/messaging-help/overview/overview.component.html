<h2 class="mat-title">Message Interface Modeler (MIM) Overview</h2>
<p class="mat-body-2">
	The purpose of the tool is to manage the software interfaces between
	subsystems for a Product Line. MIM models the messages moving across the
	network in detail, including their source, destination and composition. MIM
	allows users to mark data artifacts with an applicability which is the
	vessel by which Product Line is implemented.
</p>
<p class="mat-body-2">
	The MIM tool can be used to export data in various formats. For example, an
	ICD can be exported in an Excel Workbook format, or the data can be exported
	into a zip of text files to be used in downstream tools. The
	<a href="../../reports/">Reports Page</a> will list available reports for
	your installation.
</p>

	Below is sequence of screenshots of the tool to show the data flows:
