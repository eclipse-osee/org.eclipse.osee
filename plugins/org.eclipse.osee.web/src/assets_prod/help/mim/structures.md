## Structures Page

This page will list all defined structures within the ICD and for each row, the user can see what Message/SubMessages the structure is used in. This form has a search field to narrow down the list as needed. For Example, the word “Structure1” is in the filter field and only one result is returned with a link to get to the structure itself to allow for viewing/editing.
