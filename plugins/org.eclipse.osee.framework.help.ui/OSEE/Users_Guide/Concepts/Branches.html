		<h1 id="Branches">Branches</h1>
		<p>A fundamental feature provided by OSEE is the concurrent management of multiple variants or lines of a product. After a set of requirements is developed, it may become the baseline for variant sets of requirements for similar products. In other words, you may develop the same product for another customer, but have slight changes to the requirements, code, and test for features specific to that customer. </p>
		<p>Historically, this would mean maintaining completely separate "copies" of all the requirements and other artifacts. This is costly to maintain when changes from the baseline artifacts must be propagated to the other product line. The expense of this undertaking increases dramatically as more customers are added, each with their own set of requirements changes.</p>
		<p>For this reason, OSEE provides full 
			<b>branching</b> functionality. Using OSEE, it is possible to create these variant branches, record where they originated, and to apply changes made to a baseline branch to its variants.
		</p>
		<p>By default, OSEE has two system branches. The <tt>System Root Branch</tt> is the parent of all other branches in the system. The <tt>Common</tt> branch is used to store OSEE configuration information, such as users. <tt>Common</tt> is a child of <tt>System Root Branch</tt>.</p>
		<h2 id="Working_Branches">Working Branches</h2>
		<p>On complex projects, artifacts can be subject to modification by any one of hundreds of engineers. To have requirements "locked" while they are being modified by one user can cause significant delays in schedule.  The need for parallel development (multiple users working on the same requirements) is a necessity to keeping a project moving forward.  In addition, users making mistakes need the ability to revert or throw away their changes and start over without polluting the baseline branch. This is done using 
			<b>working branches</b>. A working branch is a sandbox area used to prepare a commit to a baseline branch.
