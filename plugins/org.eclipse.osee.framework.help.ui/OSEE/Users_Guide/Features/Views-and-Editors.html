		<p>The Branch Manager View, shown by default in the OSEE Perspective, shows all branches and transactions on each branch managed by OSEE in a hierarchical fashion.  By default, OSEE is initialized with two branches. The System Root Branch (visible to OSEE Administrators only) and the Common Branch. The System Root Branch is the base branch for all other branches in the system. The Common branch is used to store system-wide artifacts such as configuration artifacts, users, and user preferences.</p>

		<h2 id="Define_Navigator">Define Navigator</h2>
		<p>The Define Navigator, shown by default in the OSEE Perspective, provides a central location to launch frequently used define operations. To quickly find a define operation to execute, enter text into the filter box. This will filter out all navigation items that contains the entered text. Select the clear action (

		<h2 id="Merge_Manager">Merge Manager</h2>
		<p>The Merge Manager is used to resolve conflicts that arise when doing development on parallel branches.  The Merge Manager makes conflicts that arise easily identifiable and then provides the means for resolving the conflicts, so that the working branch can be committed. A conflict exists if the value of an attribute/artifact has changed on both the Destination and Source Branches.  For reference the Source Branch is the users working branch.  It is the branch that the user has been making changes to and would like to then add back into the Destination Branch or Baseline Branch.  Both branches are identified by name in the header of the Merge Manager.  </p>
		<p>Depending upon the conflict found, the user may have several choices for resolution.  These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Accept the value on the Source Branch and overwrite the value on the Destination Branch</li>
			<li>Accept the value on the Destination Branch and do not add any of the Source Branch changes, (These will still show up as merged on Change Reports)</li>
			<li>Create a solution that is a combination of the two changes</li>
			<li>Revert the changes on the Source Branch  (This is the only available solution when the Artifact/Attribute was deleted on the Destination Branch, will show up as no change on the Change Report)</li>
			<li>Do nothing (only possible for informational conflicts)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="GUI_Overview">GUI Overview</h3>
		<p>The GUI is organized to provide the user with an ability to quickly identify conflicts.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>The Heading</b> - The Heading contains text to help identify what is being merged. It identifies the Source Branch, and the Destination Branch.  It also provides the user with information about how many conflicts there are and if they have been resolved.  The Heading also contains easy launch icons for additional tools in connection with the Merge Manager.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Conflict Resolution Column</b> - This column provides the user information about the state of the conflict.  A blank entry in the column means that the conflict is new and has not had any actions performed on it. 
				<ul>
					<li>A 
						<img border="0" src="images/Chkbox_disabled.gif"/> indicates that conflict is in the modified state.  This means the user has begun merging the conflict but has not marked it as resolved.  The user may transition it into the resolved state by left clicking on the 
						<img border="0" src="images/Chkbox_disabled.gif"/> icon. 
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Accept.gif"/> icon indicates the user has marked the conflict as resolved.  This means they have selected a value for it and have verified the value going in is what they want.  No additional changes are allowed on a conflict once it is in the resolved state.  It can be placed back into the modified state by left clicking on the 
						<img border="0" src="images/Accept.gif"/> icon. 
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Chkbox_enabled_conflicted.gif"/> means that a conflict was in the resolved state but a new change has occurred on either the Source or Destination Branch.  It serves to notify the user that the conflict was not in the finalized state when they resolved the conflict.  The user can return to resolved state by left clicking on the 
						<img border="0" src="images/Chkbox_enabled_conflicted.gif"/> icon. 
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Red_light.gif"/> icon indicates that an Artifact or Attribute must be reverted on the Source Branch.  This indicates that the Artifact/Attribute was deleted on the Destination Branch and can not have a change committed onto it.  The user must abandon any change to that artifact attribute by using the revert command.  Once the Artifact/Attribute has been reverted the Merge Manager will be refreshed and the conflict will be removed. 
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Issue.gif"/> icon indicates an informational conflict.  The user does not have to take any action to resolve these conflicts.  It just provides the information that the Source Branch deleted the Artifact/Attribute but the Destination Branch has been modified.  The user is free to act as desired based on the provided information.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Artifact Name Column</b> - This column tells which artifact the conflict occurred on.  If the name is different between the Source and Destination Branches, (this will show up as a conflict) it will at first showing use the Source Branch value and then use whatever the name is resolved to be after that has occurred.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Artifact Type Column</b> - Simply lists what type of Artifact is conflicted
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Conflicting Item Column</b> - In the case of an attribute conflict it states what attribute type is conflicting.  In the case of an artifact conflict it will always say "Artifact State"
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Source Value Column</b> - When possible this column tells what value the Source Branch has for the conflict.  It will always have a 
				<img border="0" src="images/Green_s.gif"/> icon. If the conflicting item is Word Formatted Content the words "Stream data" will be shown.  For artifact conflicts it will either show "Modified" or "Deleted".  Left clicking on the 
				<img border="0" src="images/Green_s.gif"/> icon will populate the Merge Branch with value found on the Source Branch.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Destination Value Column</b> - When possible this column tells what value the Destination Branch has for the conflict.  It will always have a 
				<img border="0" src="images/Blue_d.gif"/> icon. If the conflicting item is Word Formatted Content the words "Stream data" will be shown.  For artifact conflicts it will either show "Modified" or "Deleted".  Left clicking on the 
				<img border="0" src="images/Blue_d.gif"/> icon will populate the Merge Branch with value found on the Destination Branch.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The Merge Value Column</b> - The Merged Value column serves to show the user the value that has been selected for use when the Branch is committed.  The Merge value is actually kept on a new "Merge Branch" and so any changes made to it will not affect the value seen on the Source or Destination Branches.  When the Merge Value column is blank with no icon, the conflict is informational and no actions are provided.  
				<ul>
					<li>When the Merge Value column contains a 
						<img border="0" src="images/Conflict.gif"/> icon the value has not been set.  This is the icon that should be shown for all conflicts (Except informational conflicts, or same value conflicts) the first time the user brings up the merge manager.  
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Green_s.gif"/> icon indicates that the Source Value was selected as the final value.  The actual Source Value text will also be shown in this column if possible. 
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Blue_d.gif"/> icon indicates that the Destination Value was selected as the final value.  The Destination Value text will also be shown in this column if possible. 
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<img border="0" src="images/Yellow_m.gif"/> icon will be shown when a new value has been selected for the final value.  This indicates that the user has modified the final value so that it is no longer a copy of the Source or Destination, but some variation thereof. 
					</li>
					<li>A 
						<img border="0" src="images/Accept.gif"/> icon indicates that although both the Source Branch Value and Destination Branch Value have changed they were both changed to the same value and so there is not really a conflict. Left clicking on the icon in the Merge Value column will bring up the Merge Wizard or in the case of un-resolvable conflicts a dialog offering the ability to revert the conflicting item.

		<h3 id="Word_Formatted_Content_Conflict_Resolution">Word Formatted Content Conflict Resolution</h3>
		<p>Resolution of conflicts is provided in two different ways.  They can either copy and paste the changes into their Merge Artifact document or they can generate a Three Way Merge and accept the changes that show up in the generated document.  Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages and are best suited for different situations.  They can also be combined where the situation warrants it, however the three way merge must always be done first if this is the case.</p>
		<h3 id="Manual_Merging">Manual Merging</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Usage:</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When one version of the artifact has many changes and the other version has very few changes</li>
			<li>When both files have formatting changes</li>
			<li>When three way merging generates a complex document</li>
			<li>When both versions edit the same text in multiple places</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Manual Merging is the process of combining the Source Branch changes and the destination branch changes manually by copying and pasting them into the Merge Artifact document.  The Merge Artifact is a separate version of the artifact that will preserve the details of the Merge, and will be reviewable in the Merge Manager after an artifact is committed.  IMPORTANT: If the user makes the changes to their Source Branch instead of on the Merge Artifact the Merge Manager will incorrectly represent the merge in future reviews.</p>
		<p>The following procedure illustrates the functionality available to facilitate a manual merge.</p>
		<p>The user will first either launch the Merge Wizard by left clicking on the icon in the Merge Value column of the GUI or they may select the functionality from the right click menu for the conflict in question.  The first thing to do is to bring up a word document comparison of both the Source Branch Version and the Destination Branch Version.  These documents will show all of the changes that have been made to these two artifacts since the Source Branch was created.  To launch these difference's the user either select "Show Source Diff" and "Show Destination Diff" from the wizard or "Differences"-&gt;"Show Source Branch Differences" and "Differences"-&gt;"Show Destination Branch Differences" from the right click menu.  These will bring up the two difference's in different Word instances with window labels to allow the user to differentiate the files.  The intention of bringing up these difference's is twofold.  Firstly, it allows the user to identify the file that has the most changes.  Secondly, it will come in use later when the user copy's and paste's changes into the Merge document.</p>
		<p>Upon identifying the branch that has the most changes the user should then set the Merge Artifact to contain that branches value.  This is done by either selecting "Populate with Source Data" or "Populate with Destination Data" from the Merge Wizard or left clicking on the icon or the icon in the Source and Destination Value columns in the Merge Manager GUI.  The user can then bring up the Merge Artifact for editing by clicking on "Edit Merge Artifact" in the Merge Wizard or in the right click menu.  The Document that comes up contains the Merge Artifact and any changes made to it will be reflected when the Source Branch is committed.  The user can than begin to copy the changes from the diff report that showed the fewest changes (opposite of the one chosen as the baseline).  After all changes have been migrated into the Merge Artifact document the user than saves the document, which will preserve the Merge Artifact value.  The user should be aware that any changes they do not wish to preserve from either the Source or Destination version of the Artifact need to be omitted on the Merge Artifact.</p>
		<p>The user then right clicks on the in the Conflict Status Column so that the icon is displayed.  The conflict is resolved and will allow the Source Branch to be committed.</p>
		<h4 id="Three_Way_Merge">Three Way Merge</h4>
		<p>
			<b>Usage:</b>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When both versions have many changes or both versions have few changes.</li>
			<li>When only one file has formatting changes (Must be combined with Manual Merging in this case)</li>
			<li>When three way merging generates an understandable document </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Three Way Merging leverages Microsoft Words ability to merge documents.  At the beginning of any Word Formatted Content merge it is recommended that user generate a Three Way Merge and check the complexity of the document.  In most cases Three Way Merging is a quicker way to merge two documents, however in some cases the Three Way Merge will generate a document that is difficult to use and understand.  This usually arises when the Source and Destination branches have edited the same text or if one of the branches has touched a large percentage of the file.  As it runs fairly quickly it is always a good idea to run it at the beginning of a Merge to check if it is useful.  Three Way Merging only allows the user to maintain format changes from one of the documents.  If format changes are made on both documents the Three Way Merge will prompt the user as to which format changes they would like to maintain, the user will then need to copy the format changes from the other document into the Merge Artifact document manually.</p>
		<p>A Three Way Merge is generated by selecting Generate Three Way Merge from either the Merge Wizard or the right click menu.  IMPORTANT: Generating a Three Way Merge will discard any changes made to the Merge Artifact, therefore a prompt will make sure this is the intended operation.  If a user had started a Three Way Merge previously but had not completed the Merge the user is also given the option of continuing the previous Merge in the prompt (Selecting Edit Merge Artifact will also have this effect). The following is an example of a Three Way Merge in Word.</p>
		<p>
			<img width="650" align="middle" border="0" src="images/WordThreeWayMerge.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The changes made by the Source Branch and Destination Branch are shown in different colors in the Word Document.  In this particular case the changes made in Red were done by the Source Branch and the changes made in Blue were done on the Destination Branch.  The color scheme is not consistent and the user needs to verify which color equates to which changes by hovering there mouse over one of the changes.  A popup will be shown which will identify the author.  The following Guide will explain how to resolve the changes in the document. IMPORTANT: All changes must be either accepted or rejected before the conflict can be marked as resolved.  After the user has resolved all the changes it is a good idea to do generate a difference document between the Source Artifact and the Merge Artifact, and the Destination Artifact and the Merge Artifact by selecting "Show Source/Merge Diff" and "Show Destination/Merge Diff" from the merge Wizard or "Differences"-&gt;"Show Source/Merge Differences" and "Differences"-&gt;"Show Destination/Merge Differences" from the right click menu.  These views will show the differences between the branch artifact and the merge artifact.  For the Source/Merge difference this will show everything that is different between the source document and the Merge document.  In the case where the user accepts all changes from the source and destination branches this diff will highlight all of the changes that occurred on the destination branch. In the Destination/Merge diff it will highlight all of the changes that happened on the source branch.  It is always possible to use Manual Merging techniques in conjunction with Three Way Merging.</p>
		<p>The user then right clicks on the in the Conflict Status Column so that the icon is displayed.  The conflict is resolved and will allow the Source Branch to be committed.</p>
		<p>
			<img width="400" align="middle" border="0" src="images/Word_formatted_content_merge_wizard.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Additional_Features">Additional Features</h3>
		<p>The Merge Wizard contains a "Clear the Merge Artifact" that is not available from the right click menu and only available for Word Formatted Content.  This will empty out the Merge artifact and allow the user to start with an empty document for editing.  It will also place a 
			<img border="0" src="images/Conflict.gif"/>icon in the merge value column for that conflict.

		<h3 id="Step-By-Step_Recipe">Step-By-Step Recipe</h3>
		<p>Upon selecting to commit a working branch, OSEE will prompt the user to perform a merge if conflicts are detected between the changes made on the child branch and any changes made to the parent branch since the child branch was created.  </p>

		</p>
		<p>Perform the following steps for each artifact listed on the 
			<i>Merge Manager</i> tab:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Determine which change would be the easiest to re-implement (typically the smaller and simpler of the two).  This can be done by comparing all of the changes made to this UI.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Show Source Diff</b> displays the changes made on this working branch.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Show Destination Diff</b> displays the changes made on the parent branch.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Show Source/Destination Diff</b> displays the effect on the parent branch prior to any merge management.  This view will show how the changes made on this working branch will be overwritten by the changes made on the parent branch.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Select the 
				<i>more complicated</i> of the two changes to populate the Merge Artifact: 
				<b>Populate with Source Data</b> or 
				<b>Populate with Destination Data</b>.  The Merged Value column on the 
				<i>Merge Manager</i> tab and the top-most icon in the 
				<i>Edit the attribute</i> window will update to display "S" or "D" based upon this selection.
			</li>
			<li>Select 
				<b>Edit Merge Artifact</b> to open the merge document for editing.
			</li>
			<li>Re-implement the changes from the 
				<i>simpler</i> change report.
			</li>
			<li>If at any time the merge effort needs to be cleared or re-started, select 
				<b>Clear the Merge Artifact</b>.
			</li>
			<li>The following selections may be used to review and confirm the changes made during the merge.  Prior to updating the Merge Artifact, these selections will not provide accurate information.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Show Source/Merge Diff</b> displays the additional changes beyond those made on the working branch.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Show Destination/Merge Diff</b> displays the additional changes beyond those made on the parent branch.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Select 
				<b>Finish</b>
			</li>
			<li>Under the Conflict Resolution column on the 
				<i>Merge Manager</i> tab, check the box so that the resolution status updates from "Modified" to "Resolved".
			</li>
			<li>Once all artifact conflicts have been addressed, the 
				<i>Merge Manager</i> tab will report "All Conflicts Are Resolved."  At this point, the user can return to the Workflow tab and re-initiate committing the branch.
			</li>
			<li>OSEE will display the 
				<i>Commit Branch</i> window to confirm the conflicts have been resolved via the Merge Manager. 
			</li>
			<li>Select 
				<b>Ok</b> to finish committing the branch.
