Title: A Framework for Testing the Software of Complex Systems
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/osee">Open System Engineering Environment</a> Test Environemnt (OTE) was created as a solution for verifying the 
software of the next generation Apache attack helicopter. OTE is intended for requirements based 
testing of software that is part of a larger complex system.
</p>

<p>
Some of the features of the system are:
	<li>
	A Messaging system that supports the following external I/O: ethernet, mux, serial, and wire.
	</li>
	<li>
	Tools for monitoring and manipulation of messages.
	</li>
	<li>
	A Framework for modeling different components that interact with the software. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Support multiple levels of test fidelity; from a simulated environment to labs with varying degrees of actual hardware to production line test stations to debug problems and verify that hardware is properly connected.  
	</li>
	<li>
	Remote connection to the environment including the ability to manipulate messages and models.
	</li>
	<li>
	Support for the running of thousands of tests that takes hundreds of hours to run to completion.
	</li>
	<li>
	Traceability from requirements to tests to test runs.
	</li>
	<li>
	History of test runs and a record of how failures were dispositioned.
	</li>
	<li>
	Support for publishing various documents that are delivered to the customer.
	</li>

<p>
Our environment supports different types of users; from the test team who write and run the tests to requirements writers who debug the software requirements,
 to manufacturing personal who perform checks on the final product.  In our talk we will discuss the current state of our environment, how it may be used by 
 other organizations, and what our future plans are.
